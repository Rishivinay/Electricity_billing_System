    <h3>1. Turn your refrigerator down</h3>
    <p>
    Your refrigerator consumes on average 13.7% of your total home energy use. To save electricity at home, set your fridge
    to 37 degrees Fahrenheit and your freezer to 3 degrees Fahrenheit. This way, the fridge, and the freezer will consume
    less energy.</p>

    <h3>2. Clean or replace air filters</h3>
    <p>Air conditioners and heaters use the most energy in your home and make up a large part of you electricity bill. They use
    even more energy when the air filters are dirty for them to work efficiently. Make an effort to clean and replace filters as recommended.</p>

    <h3>3. Cook using the right-sized burner</h3>
    <p>Use your stove’s small burners for small pots and large burners for large pots when cooking. You will end up using less
    energy every time you cook.</p>

    <h3>4. Use your window shades</h3>
    <p>Close your blinds to keep out the sun during summer and keep them open during winter to bring in warm rays. When you do
    this you won’t have to use a heater or an air conditioner</p>

    <h3>5. Turn off all lights, appliances, and electronics, not in use</h3>
    <p>Here’s another one of the simplest energy conservation techniques. Make it even easier by installing a power strip that
    will turn off multiple items at once. Power strips also help to efficiently distribute energy to your appliances wasting
    less electricity.</p>

    <h3>6. Repair any electrical issues in the home</h3>
    <p>Fix any electrical issues such as electrical surges, burnt out bulbs, or constant flickering. Such fixes ensure that your electrical equipment is running more efficiently while optimizing energy output.</p>

    <h3>7. Invest in energy-efficient appliances for the home</h3>
    <p>Replace old appliances such as washer, dryer, and fridge with new ones that are more energy-efficient. Look for appliances with ENERGY STAR ratings and logo. Such appliances use less energy.</p>

    <h3>8. Save money with solar energy</h3>
    <p>Solar energy is a safer alternative to electricity and gas. It is cheaper (actually almost free) and kinder to the environment.</p>

    <h3>9. Take shorter showers</h3>
    <p>Typically, you use about 20 liters of water per minute as you shower. Reducing your shower time will save water and energy as well.</p>

    <h3>10. Unplug battery chargers</h3>
    <p>This is one of the most easily ignored energy conservation techniques. We ignore it without even realizing it. Unplug chargers as soon as the batteries are fully charged or the chargers are not in use. Most chargers continue to draw power even when not charging a device.</p>
